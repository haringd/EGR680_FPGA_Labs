\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: Conclusion}
The lab demonstrates in three parts how to build up in simple steps an top level hierarchy with multiple models by using simulations to proof behavior of a module based on set parameters in a test bench. Furthermore, the synthesized model was used to generate a bit stream and loaded on to the PYNQ development board for demonstration purpose.
