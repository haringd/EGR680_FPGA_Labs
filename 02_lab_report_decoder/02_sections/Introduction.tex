\section{Introduction}\label{sec: Introduction}
The goal of the applied research is to show that closely spaced power and ground planes aid to the capacitance of the PCB board. This would mean that a on higher switching frequencies the embedded capacitance of the PCB board would add to the capacitance of decoupling capacitors.
