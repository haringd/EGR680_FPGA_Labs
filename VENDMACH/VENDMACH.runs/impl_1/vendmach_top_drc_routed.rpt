2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/char01_reg[6]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char01_reg[6]_i_1/O, cell sm/char01_reg[6]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/char02_reg[5]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char02_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell sm/char02_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/char11_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char11_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell sm/char11_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/gay_disp_reg[2]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/gay_disp_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell sm/gay_disp_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sm/ledout_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/ledout_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell sm/ledout_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
