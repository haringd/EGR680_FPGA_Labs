WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net sm/char01_reg[0]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char01_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell sm/char01_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell sm/char01_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
