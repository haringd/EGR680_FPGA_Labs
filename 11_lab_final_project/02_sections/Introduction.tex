\section{Introduction}\label{sec: Introduction}
The goal of final project is to familiarize the student with the groove connector and the possible interface methods provided with MicroBlaze and low level C code. The student will also write a software pulse width modulation (PWM). The outlined tasks are build on the PYNQ platform shown in Figure \ref{fig: intro1}. The MicroBlaze system is placed in between of the peripherals and the Zynq processing system (PS) as shown in Figure \ref{fig: intro2}. The MicroBlaze is in fact an from Xilinx developed softcore.
