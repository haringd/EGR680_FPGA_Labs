\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: Conclusion}
The lab demonstrates the use of the combined concepts of HDL logic implementation and sequential processor flow. The HDL defines the input peripherals and the seven segment decoder. The state machine and program flow can then be easy initiated in C code and flashed on the microprocessor. This combination allows a hardware acceleration of the hardware and elides un-efficient C code.
