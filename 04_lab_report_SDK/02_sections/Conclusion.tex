\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: Conclusion}
The lab demonstrates the use of the combined concepts of HDL logic implementation and sequential processor flow. The HDL defines the input peripherals and eventual logic, which is in this case none, around the embedded microprocessor. The state machine and program flow can then be easy initiated in C code and flashed on the microprocessor. This combination allows a broad spectrum of system design instead of predefined peripherals as used in a common micro-controller. A draw back is it adds complexity and a further step of development which might add complexity in maintenance and life cycle control.
